# Sheet Music Page Turner

This page-turning device was designed with reading and multitasking in mind. While devices for eBooks already exist, our solution primarily aimed to provide a cheaper hands-free alternative for physical sheet music books.

Our page turner uses two foot pedals as input and three servo motors to turn pages forward or backward. The servo motors are attached to the base of a wooden stand and a liquid crystal display (LCD) is mounted to a metal enclosure.

Ultimately, the device was successfully able to turn pages in both directions, consecutively turn up to 10 pages in a row, and digitally track the number of pages the user turned.

**Note:** Feel free to take any inspiration, but this code was not intended to be cloned and deployed. As such, I do not provide support or guidance for this.
